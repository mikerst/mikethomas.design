## The Problem(s)

At TotallyMoney, email was a key way in which we communicated with our customers. Through a mix of monthly service updates, personalised offers or well thought out journeys, we managed to maintain a high active customer base.

However, as our efforts increased in pace and sophistication, combined with an imminent rebrand and move to a new CRM platform, the team began to feel the strain. Through taking feedback from colleagues and looking at the challenges I was having in my own workflow, some key problems became apparent that we needed to address.

1. Silo'd assets that were tricky to find and reference were making it harder than it needed to be to create new email designs leading to inconsistencies creeping in to the design language.
2. The codebase we were using to create the HTML for our emails had a high barrier to entry for newcomers, particularly designers, and was also setup to cater for our previous CRM platform leading to an over reliance on one or two people to produce all new HTML emails and bottlenecks.

## My role

Working as part of a cross-functional product team, my role focused in the design and distribution of an up to date email design library, refactoring our HTML email codebase to make it simpler and easier to use, as well as educating other members of the team regarding how to make use of all the new assets and resources through one-to-one sessions, and written documentation.

## Outcomes

There were some fairly clear-cut things we needed—that we didn't have—put in place that we felt would solve the above mentioned problems.

1. Design colleagues should have a set of documented, easy-to-use assets to work from.
2. Marketing colleagues should be empowered to self-serve new emails efficiently.
3. Engineering colleagues should be able to access all email .html in a way that suits engineering workflows.

## Sketch Library

The team was already using Sketch, and so we took the decision right away to focus our efforts here on producing a library file containing all of our emails broken down in to their various elements, based loosely upon atomic design principles.

One of the key things to consider when producing any design asset or library that will be used by others is to ensure the usability of your files—the primary users for a Sketch library are going to be other designers after all. A lot of time was spent naming things in a common sense manner and ensuring a logical structure of the document.

Spinning up a new email design from one of the base templates takes mere seconds, whereas previously it would need to have been located in a job folder on the company server.

## Empowering colleagues

Writing great documentation is, in a lot of situations, a difficult task to get done. So often, it's seen as an afterthought or deprioritised in favour more critical tasks. Of course, good design documentation should be a key deliverable in any situation where you are making something that other team members will use. At TotallyMoney, we were a small team, and hadn't historically been great at making sure things were written up well.
