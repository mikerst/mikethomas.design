## Background

Social represented a key acquisition channel for TotallyMoney, driving a larger volume of new customer sign-ups than any other channel. In order to maintain momentum, we needed to provide a regular quantity of new ad creatives that could be tested against existing high-performing options.
	
## My role

As a designer who—at the time—was working across multiple teams and channels, my role consisted of some simple idea generation, storyboarding and animation using Adobe After Effects to produce some short, snappy videos to accompany various social media ads written by TotallyMoney's copywriting team. Turnaround times were tight, and we'd quite often have no more than a few hours, spread across a couple of days, to get things done.

## Simplfying production

One of the key challenges we faced was figuring out how set ourselves up so we could create ads quickly and consistently. As with another [other projects](/journal/product-launch-event/) I've mentioned in another work example, we were operating in the absense of a design system or set of guidelines, and so we chose to start creating some on the fly, as we went.
