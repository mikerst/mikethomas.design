## About

I‚Äôm a multiple-hat-wearing, purpose-driven design lead with 14+ years of experience working in B2B SaaS, enterprise and B2C contexts in logistics, education, consumer finance and energy.

__As an individual contributor__ I bring a broad, collaborative, and human-centered practice that sits at the intersection of product, brand, and innovation, with strong experience in zero-to-one stage projects, storytelling, design systems, accessibility, qualitative research and visual design. I also bring hands-on proficiency with modern front-end technologies.

__As a leader__ I bring a deeply empathetic approach to supporting the progress of colleagues while maintaining an energised and thriving team culture, with experience in strategy, ops, project management, hiring, and coaching.

I believe that good design is a non-hierarchical, multi-disciplinary team sport, and successful teams win by raising each other up.
