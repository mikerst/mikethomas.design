## About

I‚Äôm a full-spectrum designer with over 14 years of experience working in product, brand and innovation contexts across a range of industries, from logistics and education, to consumer finance and energy.

I can offer the right organisation a purpose-driven, outcome-aligned blend of both IC and leadership experience at all levels, with a strong breadth of design craft nous, and a deeply collaborative approach to supporting the progress of colleagues while developing an energised and thriving team culture.

I very firmly believe that good design is a non-hierarchical, multi-disciplinary team sport, and successful teams win by raising each other up.
