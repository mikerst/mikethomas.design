## Background 

In business and entrepreneurship, 'zero to one' refers to that primordial period in a product's lifecycle in which something is created from nothing. Maybe the idea exists, maybe the problem is clear and well understood, but typically the product or service doesn't exist yet. The value-well remains untapped.

In late 2019, in collaboration with the then-named Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in conjunction with Innovate UK, Piclo responded to a call from industry to begin solving for a range of previously identified issues in the UK energy sector.

I joined the business in early 2020, and over the next 18 months I teamed up with Piclo's innovation manager and senior software engineers to research, vision and develop a working prototype aimed at finding product-market-fit and demonstrating the first green shoots of commercial viability. 

It was a bumpy road, but we cracked it, and then the world changed, rendering our new prototype moot. 

This write-up aims to document how we approached the project, lessons learned along the way, and where things are right now (as of summer 2024). 

## First, a quick primer

_Note: Feel free to skip this if you want to get in to the project details_ and 'designy-bits'.

Electricity grids have to constantly adapt to the ebb and flow of supply and demand. The ability of a grid to do this is known as _energy flexibility_.

In the UK, ESO (colloquially referred to as National Grid) is responsible for moving electricity around nationally, as well as monitoring supply and demand in real-time. Regionally, the UK is further divided up in to 7 networks that are managed independently by different companies.

These 7 organisations, along with ESO (and overseen by Ofgem) regularly need to procure services from various providers of energy, such as EV battery operators, gas power plants, and the like, in order to meet the ongoing needs of the grid. The type of service required can vary significantly, and so these organisations design markets and supporting processes to procure specific services depending on locational, technical, economic and cyclical needs. Or: what, where, when and 'how much?'.

From the energy provider perspective, winning contracts to provide service can be highly lucrative, fuelling growth. Engaging in these markets therefore typically becomes a key pillar of their business strategies.

## High altitude problem space

However, with 8 grid operator organisations initialising multiple energy markets across different time cycles, it very quickly became difficult for energy providers to stay on top of all of the different processes, platforms and interoperability rules, with some markets requiring deep levels of expertise to see successful outcomes (winning a contract, delivering some MW, and getting paid).

Piclo is on a mission to solve this problem at the macro level across the whole market life cycle, however at the time our ambition was intentionally focussed on a few specific areas where we felt we could have more immediate and strategic impact.
