I recently tried to have a go at [Daily UI](https://www.dailyui.co/), a design challenge that sends you a design prompt on weekedays to your inbox of choice, with the goal being that after coming up with a solution for all 100 prompts, you'll be a better designer. Hooray! 

Day one arrived in my inbox and I was stumped more or less instantly. The first prompt read as follows: 

<em>Create a sign up page, modal, form, or app screen related to signing up for something. It could be for a volunteer event, contest registration, a giveaway, or anything you can imagine.</em>

It seemed simple enough, but my mind starting racing with a tonne of different questions. What kind of brand or product should I design for? Who is the customer? What sort of information should be captured up front? Should I consider social sign-in? Web app or native? How much copy is enough copy? How come I don't already know the answers to all of these questions? And so on and so.

I spent some time on Dribbble and Twitter, looking at what sort of solutions other designers were coming up with. There was a lot of great work on show, but no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't seem to get going properly, and so I got frustrated and stopped. 

As the design prompts piled up in my inbox, I tried to jump back in and do a couple, but again I got stuck on the same questions. Their open-endedness just kept scaring me off. Why?

Just as I was about to give up entirely, my partner sent me a link to [this wonderful speculatives piece](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/10/the-climate-crisis-in-2050-what-happens-if-cities-act-but-nations-dont) in The Guardian, a short piece of speculative fiction where the narrator talks about a day in their life in 2050. The article looked to explore what might our lives might look like if individual cities end up doing most of the work to tackle climate change, rather than nation states. 

The article was thought-provoking, and did a wonderful job of creating a <em>plausible</em> future impacted by climate change through the lens of mundane, every day concerns. It really resonated with me.

Later that day as I was mulling it all over, my mind drifted back to the Daily UI prompts and a connection formed in my mind. I realised that, besides doing each daily prompt as a means to hone my <em>craft skills</em>, I needed a cause or a wider purpose, and so I asked myself the question: like the article, what if I tackled each Daily UI prompt as a piece of <em>speculative design</em>? What if I looked at contemporary products and services, and imagined how they might adapt in a climate-changed world?

The idea took root, and I felt excited and motivated by the project in a way that I hadn't done beforehand. 

The practice of speculative design is something I'd always been interested in from a distance, but never really gotten up close and personal with, but what really is it? And could I consider my little Daily UI responses as speculative design?


## Speculative design

The term was first coined in the book [Speculative Everything: Design, Dreaming, and Social Dreaming](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/speculative-everything) by Fiona Ruby and Anthony Dunne. 

So what is it? Well, the following quote from the book helps:

> Speculative design thrives on imagination and aims to open up new perspectives on what are sometimes called wicked problems, to create spaces for discussion and debate about alternative ways of being, and to inspire and encourage peopleâ€™s imaginations to flow freely. Design speculations can act as a catalyst for collectively redefining our relationship to reality.
