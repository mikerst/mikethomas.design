## Background

Throughout 2018 TotallyMoney made ~£1.2 million in gross profit from sending product alert emails to customers—who'd opted-in—providing them with the latest relevent offers from the credit cards and loans markets. However, during this time the content, structure and design had remained largely unchanged.

There was a desire within the business to update and refresh the design of our alerts, to make them even better for our customers as well as more performative from a revenue point of view. We had a lot of quantitative data we could look at (open rates, click through rates, et cetera) to help inform any design decisions we might make, however we lacked anything qualitative. In order to better understand what our customers thought about our product alert emails, we chose to conduct a brief research study to see if we could uncover some useful insight.

## My role

Under the guidance of TotallyMoney's UX lead, I worked to plan, conduct and analyse a short research study that aimed to help TotallyMoney better understand what customers thought of the product alert emails being sent out on a regular basis.
