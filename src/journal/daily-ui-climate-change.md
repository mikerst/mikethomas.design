I recently signed up to [Daily UI](https://www.dailyui.co/), a design challenge that sends you a design prompt on weekedays to your inbox of choice, with the goal being that after coming up with a solution for all 100 prompts, you'll be a better designer. 

I didn't manage to do one per day, but let quite a few build up, due to a combination of procrastination, lazyness and also travelling, so I'll be tackling them in batches.

Below you can find my responses. This journal entry will grow over time to include all 100 solutions.
