## Preamble

This was mini project that only took up a small amount of time, yet had a lasting positive impact. Sometimes little things make big differences. 

## Context and role

Over a 12 month period at TotallyMoney, the business went through a significant amount of organisational change. It was an exciting and positive time, however it also came with some challenges. The design team was under pressure to juggle a lot of different tasks. With lots of stakeholders needing to request time from the design team every week, it wasn't always possible to conduct typical kick-off sessions for everyone piece of work, large or small. There just simply wasn't enough time, and so we needed to adapt.

As part of a squad of stakeholders from across the business, I worked towards helping the business find a simple, light-on-admin way in which colleagues could provide a brief to a designer, with—at a minimum—all of the essential information a designer might need to pick up a job and get started. 

## Stakeholder concerns

Our current workflow solution allowed colleagues to create a 'request' for work to be done by the deam team that was then assigned and prioritised on a weekly. Colleagues could create the request by completing a customised form within the app which would then create the job in the system. The customisation allowed us to precisely tailor the information we needed to collect up-front in order to start working on something, classify a task or, at the very least, enable us to ask the right questions. 

Unfortunately, it wasn't a universally loved process:
