<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

Generalist designer at heart with GSOH that loves to work end-to-end.

I recently concluded a six year stint at TotallyMoney, a FinTech scale-up near Silicon Roundabout, where I've worked across Brand, Marketing and Product teams, helping to grow the business through two major pivots, and from zero to over 1.5 million customers (and counting).

Throughout this time, and prior, I've had the good fortune to work with clients and organisations such as the NHS, DB Schenker, Cognita Schools, Capital One, MBNA, Barclaycard, and Zeal to name but a few.

Right now, I'm actively searching for The Next Right Role, and living the quiet life in South West London.

A head-in-the-clouds list of creative projects I'd like to tackle now, and in the future:

1. Create the layout for the front page of a newspaperâ€”digital _and_ print.
2. Design and release a (good) typeface.
3. Design, code and release a simple game on the App/Google Play Store.
4. Start a design agency, then get acquired.
5. Grow the design culture from scratch at a startup.
6. Rebrand a Fortune 500 company.
7. Win a Pencil of indeterminate colour from D&AD.
8. Create a competitive first-person-shooter.
9. Release a tiny, indie print mag.
10. Write a fantasy novel that isn't terrible and illustrate the maps myself.
