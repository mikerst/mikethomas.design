## Summary

Over a two week period, I designed and implemented a Webflow-powered solution that enabled Piclo customer support to work together with external market operator teams to centralise and standardise how key market information was distributed and presented to end users, including support for multiple languages.

The positive impact of this work was:

- End-users only had to visit one location to get the majority of the information they needed.
- We built stronger relationships with key market operator partners.
- Customer support were empowered to manage this work with minimal design and zero engineering input.
- We were able to scale this added-value to market operator partners globally, localised to their regions.

There were no major negatives, however we did underestimate the time-burden managing this content would become for our internal team.

Finally, while our analytics showed positive usage spikes during periods of high market activity, we felt overall engagement was lower than anticipated, leading us to re-consider whether or not we were focussing on the right specific problem area.

## My role

- Solo end-to-end design and implementation
- Co-ordinate internal team to ensure feasability 
- Onboard external partners to set and manage expectations
- Train internal team to manage things going forward


## The Problem

From evidence gathered via qualitative research, we learned users were having difficulty locating and parsing all of the information they needed in order to effectively participate in flexibility markets on Piclo Flex. Typically, each market operator would host important information on their own web platforms, often with differing terminology, processes, information architecture, and experience quality.

This created additional friction and work for users, as they had to keep track of data and information that lived in several different places and was simply not consistent.

This formed part of a broader wicked problem, and was raising the barrier to entry for lots of smaller businesses that didn't have the resources to navigate this complexity. This had the overall effect of harming market liquidity.

At Piclo, we didn't have the internal resource to take on this problem entirely, but we felt as though we could begin moving the needle.

### Think of it like...

Going to lots of places on the high-street to do your shopping, learning the layouts, pricing, navigating traffic.

OR

Going to one well-organised department store, with great signage and flow.

## Opportunity

- Chance to begin moving the needle on a wicked problem that was aligned to our business mission.
- Chance to lower the burden for users on both sides of the marketplace
- Chance to improve participation and therefore market liquidity
- Chance to improve relationships with market operator customers


## Constraints

- Tightly time-boxed, two week end-to-end (one sprint), tackled in amongst other duties.
- No engineering or other product resources available (aside from some ad-hoc feedback).
- Limited opportunity for collaboration with internal and external stakeholders.
- We needed to work in partnership with market operators to ensure they were happy with what we were offering.

## Key decisions made early on
- Webflow would be a good place to start
- Future productisation was...for the future

## Design artefacts and approach

The following evidences some of the design artefacts I produced during the project, with some added rationale for each.

### Early sketching

- Quick and dirty sketch in Miro, loosely considering existing design system elements.
- I did this immediately after starting the project just to start getting a sense for the shape it might take.

### Mockup for external feedback
- I was able to jump on pre-existing calls with external partners to get a little bit of feedback to help us zoom in what we felt their priorities might be.

### Scenario map

- I chose to use a simple support scenario with Piclo's customer support team in order to identify important questions and sanity check that we weren't creating a problem for ourselves.
- While very simple, this excercise helped shape some service terms we'd communicate to key customers at a later date.
- This also helped to identify what we could scope in or out early on. For example, we chose early on not to host files ourselves, but link directly to those files off-platform (something we'd later change).

### OOUX

- Object oriented UX techniques provide a great way to ground a project in the actual terms and mental models of users. 
- I did this short excercise so I had some structure to work from when considering future mockup iterations and when buliding out the CMS components in Webflow.
- I opted to orient the solution around the "Operator" concept as this is typically how end-users saw things: they were offering their services to company X and wanted to find relevant information to that company.

## Notes for hiring managers

- Given the quick turn-around nature of this project, I moved through the gears fairly quickly and jumped in to buliding out a prototype fairly quickly, thus meaning there isn't a great deal of design process material to see here.
- I no longer have access to the Webflow account associated with this project and was unable to develop any visual material about the CMS implementation work.
