This short piece was written in response to the 'Pop Quiz' questions posed in the application for the position of Interaction Designer @ IDEO.

## Q: What do you think is the most well designed website in the world?

A: Potentially controversial, but my answer (without overthinking it) would be __Amazon.com__ (.co.uk, .de, etc).


## Q: Why do you like it?

A: It's busy, cluttered, and feels fairly austere to use. However, regardless of this, the Amazon web experience makes the process of browsing, comparing and buying X items from an inventory of millions of products from a vast array of sellers effortless and convenient. 

__Digging a bit deeper, consider the following scenario:__

If I run out of coffee filters I can visit the site (leaving Alexa to one side for a second) and—because of my prior purchasing history—only need to hit one button to have more filters delivered to my door within 24 hours. No authentication, logging in, confirmation, just one button.

For that promise to be fulfilled, countless services, systems and people have to operate effectively and do their respective jobs. It's mind blowing to be able to trigger all of those processes with the simple click of a button. 

Does the button itself, and does Amazon more broadly, have the most aesthetically pleasing, joyful UI? No, it doesn't. But then it doesn't need to. The interaction layer of Amazon web works because it—via hard-earned trust, and a symbiotic relationship with it's users—reduces friction to a minimum, focusing not so much on beauty, but on utility, for as many people as possible, across as many types of device as possible. 

In countries where it operates, the 'Everything Store' works, by design, for everyone, as efficiently as technology allows, and this is why I'd argue it's (one of) the best designed websites in the world. It executes it's function on a global scale, to the benefit of all stakeholders.

## Q: If you could make it even better what would you do?

A: Amazon is vast, and so I'd like to answer this by focusing in on something small, but potentially impactful. 

Starting with my own behaviour as an Amazon customer, something that I do regularly is create lists of items I want to keep an eye on. I check in with those lists regularly to see if prices have gone down, or to see if new stock has become available.

There are a couple of ways I think this facet of Amazon's service could be potentially improved:

__1: Streamlining and better sign-posting__ 

Starting at a lower level, the UI on the web (large breakpoint) allows you to easily jump right in to one of your lists via the 'Accounts & Lists' dropdown menu, however on the native app (Android, in my case right now), this is not possible. In fact, the labelling and terminology seems inconsistent. Amazon web talks about "lists" plural, whereas the native app is setup to focus on directing you to your "Wish List" (one of Amazon's pre-defined lists), but it actually loads your 'default list' (which you can assign). This is potentially confusing. The option to jump to a different list is present, but it's not as easily discoverable.

I should imagine that there are reasons for this point of difference, but I'd be interested in questioning whether or not this should be the case, and looking at some data (qual/quant) surrounding how customers use the feature across breakpoints and devices to see if some degree of closer alignment might occur, both in terms of user flows, and labelling/nomenclature.

What I (personally) as a user in this scenario want to do is see a top level view of my lists and tap on the one I want to view as a first port of call. My hunch here is that I'm not alone and I'd want to investigate this further.

__2: Automation__ 

Looking at it from a higher vantage point, the outcome I want as a customer is—via getting an item on my list for the best possible price—to save money and get better value. Rather than do this manually, how might some this process be automated? And, how could such a feature work on behalf of both sellers and buyers (and Amazon itself, of course)?

Beyond the business-case, I'd want to consider how this might be implemented across multiple touchpoints, from the web, to the inbox, to device in your pocket.

Again, speaking from personal experience, I wait for prices to drop on certain items before purchasing, because I <em>know</em> that they will drop (I've seen an item listed at a lower price before). Broadly, my hunch here is that this is a common activity (it is something you can do with third-party apps and services already), and so sensitively building out a similar feature within Amazon itself could potentially yield benefits for all stakeholders.
