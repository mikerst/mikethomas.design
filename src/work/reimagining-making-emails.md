## Background

During my time at TotallyMoney, email was a key way in which we communicated with our customers. Through a mix of monthly service updates, personalized offers or engaging guide content, we managed to maintain a very high active customer base as well as generate significant amounts of revenue. 

The email touchpoints in our CRM programme were well thought out and effective, yet as the business grew, and our efforts increased in sophistication and pace, the team began to feel the strain. Through taking feedback from colleagues and looking at the challenges I was having in my own workflow, some key problems became apparent that we needed to address.

### Key problems

1. Inconsistencies in our email design language.
2. Lack of design documentation.
3. Hard-to-handle HTML, with a high technical barrier to entry.
4. Resource bottlenecks during busier periods.


### Wider business context

At the time the work was commencing, we were aware that a company rebrand was on the horizon, and so the project provided an opportunity to audit, slim down and generally perform a bit of housekeeping on our email ecosystem with a view to more easily rolling out a brand refresh at a later date.

We were also transitioning to a new data-driven CRM platform, and so we needed to spend time refactoring our email codebase to better leverage the new environment, including rewriting all base components and templates, as well as accompanying documentation.

## Outcomes & Role

There were some fairly clear-cut things we needed—that we didn't have—put in place that we felt would solve the above mentioned problems.

1. Design colleagues should have a set of documented, easy-to-use assets to work from.
2. Marketing colleagues should be empowered to self-serve new emails efficiently.
3. Engineering colleagues should be able to access all email .html in a way that suits engineering workflows.

Working as part of a cross-functional product team, my role focused in the design and distribution of an up to date email design library, refactoring our HTML email codebase to make it simpler and easier to use, as well as educating other members of the team regarding how to make use of all the new assets and resources through one-to-one sessions, and written documentation.

## Sketch Library

The team was already using Sketch, and so we took the decision right away to focus our efforts here on producing a library file containing all of our emails broken down in to their various elements, based loosely upon atomic design principles.

One of the key things to consider when producing any design asset or library that will be used by others is to ensure the usability of your files—the primary users for a Sketch library are going to be other designers after all. A lot of time was spent naming things in a common sense manner and ensuring a logical structure of the document.

Spinning up a new email design from one of the base templates takes mere seconds, whereas previously it would need to have been located in a job folder on the company server.

## Empowering colleagues

Writing great documentation is, in a lot of situations, a difficult task to get done. So often, it's seen as an afterthought or deprioritised in favour more critical tasks. Of course, good design documentation should be a key deliverable in any situation where you are making something that other team members will use. At TotallyMoney, we were a small team, and hadn't historically been great at making sure things were written up well. 

## More accessible codebase
