## Background

This is mini project that only took up a small amount of time, yet had a lasting positive impact. Sometimes little things make big differences. 

Over a 12 month period at TotallyMoney, the business went through a significant amount of organisational change. It was an exciting and positive time, however it also came with some challenges. The design team was under pressure to juggle a lot of different tasks. With lots of stakeholders needing to request time from the design team every week, it wasn't always possible to conduct typical kick-off sessions for everyone piece of work, large or small. Temporarily, there was a need to try and reduce the amount of meetings happening in favour a more hands-off approach. 


## Role

As part of a squad of stakeholders from across the business, I worked towards helping the business find a simple, light-on-admin way in which colleagues could provide a brief to a designer, with—at a minimum—all of the essential information a designer might need to pick up a job and get started. 

## Existing workflow

Our current workflow solution allowed, for example, colleagues from marketing to create a 'request' for work to be done that was then prioritsed on a weekly basis and picked up by a member of the team, and tracked via a customisable kanban board. Colleagues could create the request by completing a form within the app which would then create the job in the system. This was was totally customisable, allowing us to precisely tailor the information we needed to collect up front in order to start working on something.
