For nearly fifteen years, I’ve combined Product, Service and Visual Design disciplines—with a side-order of front-end—to help start-ups, scale-ups and enterprises grow, level-up, and move faster.

My design stack currently includes a lot of Figma, Miro, Obsidian for writing, and ChatGPT for moving faster, although I’ll never tire of getting messy with pens and paper.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about running, great coffee, and old book smells. I'm currently teaching myself how to play <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/multiplehatguy" target="_blank">chess properly</a>, targeting a half marathon pb, and am informally developing some coaching skills aimed at early-career designers and creatives.
