## Preamble

This was mini project that only took up a small amount of time, yet had a lasting positive impact. Sometimes little things make big differences. 

## Context and role

Over a 12 month period at TotallyMoney, the business went through a significant amount of organisational change. It was an exciting and positive time, however it also came with some challenges. The design team was under pressure to juggle a lot of different tasks. With lots of stakeholders needing to request time from the design team every week, it wasn't always possible to conduct typical kick-off sessions for everyone piece of work, large or small. There just simply wasn't enough time, and so we needed to adapt.

As part of a squad of stakeholders from across the business, I worked towards helping the business find a simple, light-on-admin way in which colleagues could provide a brief to a designer, with—at a minimum—all of the essential information a designer might need to pick up a job and get started. 

## Stakeholder concerns

Our current workflow solution allowed colleagues to create a 'request' for work to be done by the team that was then assigned and prioritised on a weekly. Colleagues could create the request by completing a customised form within the app which would then create the job in the system. The customisation allowed us to precisely tailor the information we needed to collect up-front in order to start working on something, classify a task or, at the very least, enable us to ask the right questions. 

Unfortunately, it wasn't a universally loved process:

## Briefing is hard

Writing good design briefs can be very difficult. For projects with lots of stakeholders, overlapping business goals and complex requirements, trying to distill everything down in to a succinct, clearly structured format can be a real challenge, and is soemthing that requires strong collaboration. 

For this piece of work, it was acknowleged that these aren't the kinds of brief we were concerned about. We'd be focusing on the lower level, simpler thing. As a designer, you naturally want to facilitate the creation of a project brief, but when the work is fairly routine and has a regular cadence, it's reasonable to take a more relaxed approach.

## Introducing The Five Ws 

To empower colleagues to supply light weight design briefs to the team we needed a flexible, simple and robust way to frame the capturing of information. After a short period of research, we landed on The Five Ws. 

The Five Ws are a set of basic, fundamental questions whose purpose is to draw out the minimum required information neeed to help solve a problem. They are:


1. What are we making/creating? (Deliverables)
2. Who is the work for? [Audience]
3. Where will it be seen/experienced? [Touchpoints]
4. When is this needed by? [Deadlines/Timings]
5. Why are we making it? [Context/Reason to do it]
