## Background

A good developer friend of mine wanted a logo to appear on the labels for her children’s apparel work that she was doing in her spare time. The brand name is a play on a Swedish phrase ‘Bytt e bytt’ (roughly—what is traded is traded). In this instance, ‘what is sewn, is sewn’. 
	
## Logomark

The logomark consists of a simple thread running through the eye of a needle in the shape of an S. This is left fairly loose and informal, so as remain in keeping with the home-made nature of the apparel. A couple of minor variations were considered, but are not worth displaying here.

## Typeface

We wanted to continue the home-made and playful theme, and so we chose to use a typeface called Indie Flower, [available freely](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Indie+Flower) on Google Fonts, designed by Kimberly Geswein.

## Combination Mark

Rather than use a separate stand-alone logotype, the S is dropped to avoid creating the impression of a double S and the need to section off the logomark.

Honestly, I wish I could say that there are lots of moodboards and iterations to show, but we landed on something fairly quickly, and sometimes that’s OK.  The logo consists of a couple of different weights, to allow for differing label sizes and to accommodate different fabric types and thread weights. 

Sometimes small, fun, unpaid projects are a delight to work on and it’s particular satisfying to see your work on something physical.
